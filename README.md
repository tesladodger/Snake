# Snake

Snake game with AI option.


## A* Pathfinding

The game's AI mode uses a version of the A* algorithm entirely made by me.

The head of the snake is the start and the food is the goal.

The tail sections are the obstacles, but only if they can be reached (this is explained better in the code).


## Configuration

In the config file, settings like the delay between moves, as well as the high score, are stored.


## But does it work?
